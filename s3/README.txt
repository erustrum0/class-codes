These programs were entirely written by me (build script as well).
These programs were listed until the module called If/Else and are supposed to help us get familiar with conditionals.

p6.cpp and p9.cpp are more complex than the others. p6.cpp uses a library called "getch.h" for letting the user input a character without needing
    to use the enter key. This makes it easier to input characters and removes the potential for a user to type in multiple characters. It also has
    the ability to recognize numbers as opposed to just vowels and consonants. I also added an easter egg (try the exclaimation mark character!) to
    the program. p6simple.cpp removes the "getch.h" dependency but can only determine if a character is a vowel or not (for code size considerations).
    The p9.cpp program uses a mapped array (I think people just call them maps) to associate numbers with the names of months. p7simple.cpp uses a
    basic switch statement to do the same thing.
